An app for customers of bars/resturants that want control over what music is playing from the touch of a button on their own phone.

## How It Works

Jukebox allows customers to take control of what music they would like to play for free from the touch of a button. Just sign up with the app, search for the songs available in the bar you are at, and start selecting which ones you would like to hear. Users can view what songs are already in the bar's queue for songs to play in the Bar's Queue and can also see what songs they have added to the list in the Your Queue view. Your Queue allows a user to update a song if they change their mind without losing their spot in the Bar's Queue.

## Approach
The approach to building this application was to take it as slow as possible and start with one small thing at a time. There is A LOT i would still love to do with this app but put in the MVP features with the time I had. I stood up one API call at a time until I had a fully functional horrific looking application. From that point i started to work on the UI from a functional standpoint then moved to non-functional.

## Unresolved Issues
I think if i had more time the next thing i would take a look at would be the songs scrolling behind the footer buttons when the screen gets too small. I needed the buttons to stay at the bottom so needed to fix them but that also takes them out of the flow of the document. On a desktop it works perfectly okay but noone takes a desktop to the bar.

I would like to add alot! animations, Maps API (this will also allow me to delete a users songs from the queue when they physically leave the bar rather than a button), song voting on the bar queue view to bump songs by popularity. A bars version of the app.

## Original User Stories
1. As a bar customer i would like to be able to search for songs i would like to play so that i can add them to a queue.
2. As a bar customer i would like to be able to add songs to the bar's queue so that they can be played.
3. As a bar customer i would like to be able to see what song I have specifically added to the queue so i can keep track of songs i am added.
4. As a bar customer i would like to be able to have my queue refreshed everytime i login so that i can have a fresh start at each bar.
